Community contributions are one of the key points that make open source software so great.
And concrete5 is no exception, so we'd like to thank you for your help.

- Adopting a common coding style makes developers life easier and may be helpful in finding some kind of bugs. Furthermore, like @aembler once said, we have to be good citizens: speaking the same dialect is useful for everybody. So, please be sure to consult the [Coding-Style Guidelines](https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/wiki/Coding-Style-Guidelines).

- If you used to develop for concrete5 Legacy (v5.6 and older), you should read the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/wiki/Migration-Guide): it explains some of the main differences introduced in concrete5 5.7 and later.
