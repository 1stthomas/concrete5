Community contributions are one of the key points that make open source software so great.
And concrete5 is no exception, so we'd like to thank you for your help.

Before submitting pull requests, please be sure to read these pages:

- Adopting a common coding style makes developers life easier and may be helpful in finding some kind of bugs. Furthermore, like @aembler once said, we have to be good citizens: speaking the same dialect is useful for everybody. So, please be sure to consult the [Coding-Style Guidelines](http://www.concrete5.org/documentation/developers/5.7/background/coding-style-guidelines).

- If you used to develop for concrete5 Legacy (v5.6 and older), you should read the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/wiki/Migration-Guide): it explains some of the main differences introduced in concrete5 5.7 and later.

- This is **not** a repository for unconfirmed bugs. If this is an unconfirmed bug (and almost all of them are), they should be posted to the [official concrete5 bug tracker](http://www.concrete5.org/developers/bugs) so that they can be confirmed and voted on. Just because something is posted here does not guarantee it will be placed into a release milestone.

Thanks everyone!
